# Big O Notes

### Introduction
Describes the time growth of an algorithm, based on its inputs. Only depends on the algorithm itself and not the machine.

O(g(n)) <- bounded above by g(n)

Only write the highest order "n" inside O

**Example**

`
for(int i=n -1; i>=0; i--) {
	for(int j =9; j>0; j--) {
		System.out.println(" hello ");
	}
}
`
